# Personal workspace

## What We Are Building

The Personal workspace app is a centralized platform where users can add and manage content from various sources such as Twitter, YouTube, and Google Docs. This app serves as a personal knowledge management system, allowing users to store, organize, and retrieve information efficiently.

## Features of the Project

- **Content Management**: Add and manage links to threads, videos, articles, and documents from various sources.
- **Centralized Storage**: Store all your content in one place for easy access and organization.
- **AI Query**: Use AI to search and interact with your stored content.
- **Future Enhancements**: Create embeddings from the stored data to enhance search capabilities.

## Technical Approach

The Second Brain App is built using the MERN stack with TypeScript for type safety and better development experience. The technical approach includes:

- **Frontend**: Developed using React.js with TypeScript for building a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Backend**: Implemented using Node.js and Express.js with TypeScript for handling API requests and server-side logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used for storing user data and content in a scalable and flexible manner.
- **AI Integration**: Incorporate AI models to enable advanced search and interaction capabilities with the stored content.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI**: Integration with AI models for enhanced search functionality
